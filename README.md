# Snake-game-using-ATMega32
This is a snake game much like the one in old phones. 
User input is two push buttons, left and right corresponding to the direction one would like to turn.
Displayed on an 8x8 bicolor LED matrix, is the snake in red and the food in green.
The LED matrixis multiplexed, with a common anode for red and green LEDs and control via the ground terminals, as will be clear in the code.
